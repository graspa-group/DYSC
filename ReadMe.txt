The DYSC software implements the space-time mixture model detailed in the paper "Dynamic model-based clustering for spatio-temporal data" by Lucia Paci and Francesco Finazzi.
Source code and demos are provided in the Src and Demo folders, respectively.

The code has been developed and tested on MATLAB 9.1.0 (R2016b).
